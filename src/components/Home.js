flawless  look, and someone  without any  technical  background  would
definitely  appreciate  it.  The layout makes anyone feel  comfortable

                        The load time of the page is quite  fast,  even with the  moving  link
buttons.  I did not find any typos or broken  links,  just  very  well
written  information!  There are  sufficient  meta tags on the  pages.
The  CharityFocus  logo is present on the main page but not on the sub
pages.  Overall a great site with not only great design but  excellent
content as well.  Great job to everyone involved.

                        This site  would  appeal to the  average  person in the way that it is
very simply  done, and  everything  is very easy to find.  There is no
messing  around  here, just the  information  that they want to convey
presented in the simplest way possible.  People with no technical back
ground  would  definitely   appreciate  the  simplicity  and  ease  of
navigation in this site.
